# CURA Healthcare Demo Website Project

This project is a demonstration of using <link>Katalon Studio</link> for automated testing of the CURA Healthcare demo website.

## Introduction

The CURA Healthcare demo website is a web application that allows users to book appointments with doctors and manage their healthcare needs. This project aims to automate the testing of various features and functionalities of the website using <link>Katalon Studio</link>.

## Features

- Automated testing of user registration and login functionality
- Automated testing of appointment booking and management
- Automated testing of search functionality for doctors and healthcare services
- Automated testing of user profile management

## Test Cases

<link>Katalon Studio</link> allows you to create and manage test cases, which are individual steps or actions that simulate user interactions with the CURA Healthcare demo website. Test cases can be created using the <link>Katalon Studio</link> IDE, which provides a user-friendly interface for designing and executing tests.

To include test cases in your project, follow these steps:

1. Open <link>Katalon Studio</link> and create a new test case.
2. Define the necessary test steps, such as navigating to specific pages, filling out forms, and verifying expected results.
3. Save the test case and add it to the appropriate test suite.

## Test Suites

Test suites in <link>Katalon Studio</link> are collections of test cases that can be executed together. They allow you to organize and manage your tests more efficiently. Test suites can be created using the <link>Katalon Studio</link> IDE, and they provide a way to group related test cases and execute them as a single unit.

To include test suites in your project, follow these steps:

1. Open <link>Katalon Studio</link> and create a new test suite.
2. Add the desired test cases to the test suite by selecting them from the available test case list.
3. Configure the test suite settings, such as the execution order and any necessary test data.
4. Save the test suite and execute it to run all the included test cases.

## Prerequisites
